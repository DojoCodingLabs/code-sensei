### A free, open-source Claude Code plugin that teaches programming while you vibecode — by [Dojo Coding](https://dojocoding.io)

**CodeSensei** is a **Claude Code plugin** that turns every coding session into a learning session. Like Duolingo, but for coding — and instead of fake exercises, you learn from **your own projects** in real-time.

No prior coding experience needed. Seriously.

## The Problem

10 million people are vibecoding — prompting AI to build apps without understanding a single line of code. They ship incredible things, but they learn **nothing**. The moment something breaks, they're stuck.

Traditional education says "learn first, then build." But vibecoders are already building. They're not going backwards.

## The Insight

The most powerful classroom is the one you're already sitting in.

Vibecoders don't lack curiosity — they lack **context**. When Claude creates a React component, they want to know what just happened. When it sets up a database, they want to know why.

The questions are already there. Nobody's answering them. **Until now.**

## The Solution

CodeSensei is an AI mentor that lives inside Claude Code. As you build, it explains what's happening, why decisions were made, and quizzes you along the way — all adapted to your skill level through a martial arts belt progression system.

You build your project. CodeSensei builds your understanding.

- 🧠 **Contextual learning** — explanations from *your actual code*, not generic examples
- 🥋 **Belt progression** — White Belt to Black Belt, earned through real understanding
- 🧩 **Micro-quizzes** — comprehension checks that earn XP, not memorization drills
- 🔥 **Streaks & XP** — daily streaks and experience points that persist across projects
- 🎯 **Adaptive difficulty** — set your background (marketing, design, finance) and get analogies from *your field*

## 🥋 Belt Progression System

```
⬜ White Belt    →     0 XP    "You wrote your first prompt"
🟡 Yellow Belt   →   500 XP    "You understand files & folders"
🟠 Orange Belt   → 1,500 XP    "You get frontend vs backend"
🟢 Green Belt    → 3,500 XP    "You can read and modify code"
🔵 Blue Belt     → 7,000 XP    "You understand APIs & databases"
🟤 Brown Belt    → 12,000 XP   "You can architect a full app"
⚫ Black Belt    → 20,000 XP   "You think like an engineer"
```

Every explanation, every quiz, every session earns XP. Every belt promotion is a milestone worth celebrating.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add DojoCodingLabs/code-sensei
/plugin install code-sensei@code-sensei
```

That's it. Start building — CodeSensei activates automatically.

> **Requires:** [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) with plugin support. Hook scripts use `jq` for profile tracking — install with `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux).

### Updating

```bash
# Update the marketplace catalog first:
claude plugin marketplace update DojoCodingLabs/code-sensei

# Then update the plugin:
claude plugin update code-sensei@code-sensei
```

Restart your Claude Code session after updating — hooks are loaded at session start.

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DojoCodingLabs/code-sensei.git
cd code-sensei

# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add .
/plugin install code-sensei
```

## 🎮 Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/code-sensei:explain` | Explain what Claude just did, in terms you understand |
| `/code-sensei:quiz` | Test your understanding with a contextual quiz |
| `/code-sensei:why` | Understand *why* Claude made a specific decision |
| `/code-sensei:progress` | View your full learning dashboard |
| `/code-sensei:recap` | End-of-session summary of everything you learned |
| `/code-sensei:level` | Adjust difficulty or set your background field |
| `/code-sensei:belt` | View your current belt rank and progress |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **You vibecode normally** — prompt Claude to build whatever you want
2. **Hooks track what happens** — file changes, commands run, technologies used
3. **You ask when curious** — `/code-sensei:explain`, `/code-sensei:quiz`, `/code-sensei:why` whenever you want to learn
4. **CodeSensei adapts** — explanations match your belt level and background
5. **You level up** — XP accumulates, belts are earned, skills unlock
6. **Progress persists** — your profile lives at `~/.code-sensei/` and works across all projects

### Adaptive Teaching

CodeSensei's AI mentor adapts its entire communication style to your level:

**⬜ White Belt hears:**
> "Claude added a 'translator' to your server. When someone fills out your form, the data arrives as raw text. This translator converts it into something your code can read — like translating a letter from another language."

**🔵 Blue Belt hears:**
> "Express middleware was added to parse incoming JSON. This sits in the request pipeline before your route handlers, so `req.body` is already a JavaScript object by the time your code runs."

Same concept. Different depth. Always from **your project**, not a generic example.

### Background-Specific Analogies

Set your field with `/code-sensei:level background marketing` and CodeSensei speaks your language:

- **Marketing:** "An API is like a campaign brief — you send specific requirements, and the server delivers exactly what you asked for."
- **Design:** "Components are like design system elements — reusable, consistent, and composable."
- **Finance:** "A variable is like an account balance — it holds a value that changes over time."
- **Medicine:** "Error handling is like triage — you check for the most critical problems first."

### What Gets Tracked

- ✅ File types and technologies Claude uses (for contextual teaching)
- ✅ Your XP, belt level, quiz history, and streak
- ❌ No personal data, no code content, no telemetry, no external calls

Everything stays on your machine in `~/.code-sensei/`.
